## Introduction

"Footprint Friend" is a carbon footprint tracker app designed to help users calculate and reduce their carbon footprint. It offers a user-friendly interface for inputting data, calculates the carbon footprint, and stores the data in AWS DynamoDB. The app utilizes AWS Lambda and API Gateway for its backend, employs D3.js for data visualization, and includes a machine learning model to recommend steps for reducing the carbon footprint.

## Features

- **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Users can input various data to calculate their carbon footprint, including transportation, energy consumption, and lifestyle choices.

- **AWS Integration:** Data is securely stored in AWS DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda powers the backend scripts. API Gateway is used to deploy APIs.

- **Machine Learning Recommendations:** A machine learning model provides personalized recommendations for reducing carbon footprint based on user input.

- **Data Visualization:** D3.js is used to create graphical representations of user data, making it easier to understand and track progress.

- **Social Media Sharing:** Users can share their progress and achievements on multiple social media platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React

- **Backend:** Node.js, AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB

- **API Deployment:** AWS API Gateway

- **Machine Learning:** (Specify the machine learning framework or tools used)

- **Data Visualization:** D3.js
